# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
